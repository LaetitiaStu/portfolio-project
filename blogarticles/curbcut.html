            Dear Mrs. Rowling and whom else it may concern,

      <div class="content">

            <p>
              I wrote to your ForWomen scam a while ago with a question. I have
              yet to receive an answer. Perhaps you can help Mrs Rowling. <br />
              There was this statement on the website <br />
              "We believe that there are only two sexes, that a person’s sex is
              not a choice, nor can it be changed. Women are entitled to
              dignity, safety and fairness." <br />
              And I was wondering what the causal connection between the two
              sentences. <br />
              Might I introduce you to the Curb Cut Effect? <br />
              In the 1970s a group of disability activists created a make-shift
              curb cut in Berkeley, with some cement and a quick get-away. It
              was the starting point for hundreds and later hundreds of
              thousands of curb cuts to be introduced, though didn’t happen
              without resistance. <br />
              And the exciting thing: <br />
              It was not only wheelchair users who benefitted, not even close.
              Parents with strollers, kids with roller skates, bikers,
              travelers, even the wheels of cars benefit from the softer change
              in altitude. <br />
              So, no matter whose rights you want to protect, by enabling
              accommodation they will benefit. And, according to the EU Report
              by Köhler: The adoption of self-determination models when it comes
              to gender, see improved mental health and increased awareness
              regarding equality within several subgroups of society. <br />
              Also, the availability of gender-affirming care for female-born
              people, who identify as women, such as hormonal regulators in
              cases of PCOS, fluctuating hormone levels, or the contraceptive
              pill simply for the use of contraception, will profit from further
              research, varying body types, and more awareness. <br />
              So, selfishly, as a woman, and as a woman with PCOS, I hope we can
              mprove health care, safeguarding the rights of transgender people,
              or people outside of the gender binary, because in the end, it
              will be for the best for me as well. <br />
              <br />
              Thank you in advance for your clarification! <br />
              With much concern and little regard, <br />
              <br />
              Laetitia <br />

              PS: Where in your two categories of sexes would intersex people
              belong?  Around 1% of births account for children that are born
              without fitting into the standard male or female body
              definition, which does not fit in the binary idea of sexes
              (Dreger, 1998). With  0.5% of people born with XXY chromosomes
              (Visootsak, 2006), or Gonadal Dysgenesis, which is the only
              partial development of genitalia, such as the lack of ovaries and
              uterus, while having female external genitalia, which occurs
              around once in 2500 births (Breehl, 2023). <br />
