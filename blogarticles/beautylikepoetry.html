            When I was a child, every summer my family would do this thing where
            we all place our forearms in a row and compare who is the most
            tanned. <br />I was white. <br />Not quite ghost-white, but
            camembert-cheese-white at the very least. <br />And I tried hard. My
            skin would always feel like it’s stretching over my face when lying
            in the sun, and I hated the feeling of hot sweat on my arms. But it
            was for a greater cause: winning the tanning challenge. <br />When I
            was 15 I met this guy in school, I don’t remember his name, I do
            remember that he was Korean and that he talked about how beautiful
            he though bright skin was. <br />The first thought this provokes, of
            course, is: “Perhaps I am not ugly, but merely born in the wrong
            place.” An obvious though, and a step closer to the answer, but not
            quite there. <br />It took a bit more reflection to arrive at the
            final answer. Reflection that went back to my childhood, further
            back even than the tanning competitions. <br />
            I remember when I was 5 years old, there was a girl that I adored.
            She had caramel-brown hair and a round, golden face. And she had
            this thing that you see on statues of Ancient Rome. I know now that
            people call them love handles. Then, I only knew that they looked
            like poetry. The way that sunsets with a string of clouds on the
            horizons look like poetry. Or the way the far-away mountains look on
            a cold day, when they seem like they can be blown away by a breath -
            an image you want to carve into your brain, as to never forget it.
            <br />
            It is not about finding the one place where you will be most
            conventionally attractive. It is about realizing that there is no
            such thing as objective beauty. There might be some things about you
            that some people adore and others disfavor. And when looking for
            faults in your appearance, you will find some. But just those
            things, the very things that might make you sit in the sun sweating
            like a pig, will be the epitome of beauty to others.
