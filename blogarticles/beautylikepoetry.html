            I have never been able to understand why my brother disliked men
            wearing nail polish or skirts, and why my mother thought only women
            of a certain figure could wear revealing or form-defining dresses.
            When I saw a person wearing nail polish, I was in awe, for all my
            attempts of painting my nails has resulted in a hideous bloch of
            colour on the tip of all fingers, a few on my palm and on the worst
            of occasions clothing as well. Of course, learning to draw within
            lines is a skill we were ought to learn in kindergarten, but
            painting within the rims of my nail beds was far beyond my
            capability it seemed. When I saw a person with mesmerizing
            eyeshadow, I tried to memorize and copy it later, or a dress that I
            found appealing, I thought of how wonderful having one of my own
            might be. I understood quite the principle that some things for the
            sake of hair colour or complexion would emphasize different feature,
            but else a dress that I found beautiful would not change into a
            dress that I find hideous by the face of the one in it. The idea
            that a dress that I loved, I would love less depending on the wearer
            never occurred to me, for the simple thought seems so unreasonable.
            Would it mean that if I owned a dress and lent it to two people, it
            would turn more pretty with one, and more ugly with the other? Would
            not paint on the nail, be of the same pretty colour and applied of
            the same admirable skill, wether painted on the hand of a man or of
            a woman? It seemed ridiculous, and I could not fathom the idea, I
            tried comparisons to wrap my mind around the thought, for my mother
            was seldom wrong, therefore there must be a reason beyond my
            comprehension: So I figured a work of art, a painting perhaps, might
            it look different depending on the exhibit its in or the museum itâ€™s
            housed in? Well, I figured, the plaque on the wall might give a
            different story. But the quality, the power, the value of the
            painting, would it not be the same?
